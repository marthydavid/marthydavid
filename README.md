### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**marthydavid/marthydavid** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on updating my [homelab](https://github.com/marthydavid/homelab) repo
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in kubernetes and cncf projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm only working since 2015
